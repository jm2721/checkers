A two-player checkers game (currently very far from finished) written with c++ and the gtkmm graphics library. To use, just
copy all the files and run `make` in your terminal. Need to have gtkmm installed.

To do list after I'm not so busy:
  Make the squares be managed by a "slot" method. Slot would take as input a single number between 0 and 63 inclusive,
and draw a square on that position. Drawing the board would then be a simple matter of looping through 63 calls to "slot".
This would greatly simplify piece movement because I could just move from slot x to slot y instead of recalculating the
position. 
  Splashscreen? Might be nice
  Need to fix the pieces vector. Right now it is reassigning a memory location to the pieces every time the frame changes, 
which is not good. Need to have an initial setup where all the memory locations are established, and the program then works
from there.
