A two-player checkers game (currently very far from finished) written with c++ and the gtkmm graphics library. To use, just
copy all the files and run `make` in your terminal. Need to have gtkmm installed.

To do list after I'm not so busy:
  Make the squares be managed by a "slot" method. Slot would take as input a single number between 0 and 63 inclusive,
and draw a square on that position. Drawing the board would then be a simple matter of looping through 63 calls to "slot".
This would greatly simplify piece movement because I could just move from slot x to slot y instead of recalculating the
position. 
  Splashscreen? Might be nice
